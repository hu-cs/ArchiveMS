THE ALPHA TEAM PROPOSAL FOR SERVICES
============================================

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
 
The Alpha team is pleased to submit this proposal for services to support Eslaah TV in achieving its goals for improving their data management, Archiving and retrieving Data.

### The Objective ###

The customer's objectives are as following:


* < Need #1: managing data in an efficient  manner>
* < Need #2: Archiving data in an efficient manner >
* < Need #3: Retrieving Data in an easy way>
* < Need #4 :having a report of  data>
* < Need #5:  avoiding Redundancy and duplication in data.>
* < Need #6:Prevention of data-loss (Data Backup)>

### The Opportunity ###

As we have read the clients request for proposal, we recognized that their major goal is to have better data management in their archive. So we would like to grab this opportunity and offer our solution. We would like to summarize the client's goal based on their request for proposal.
 
* < Goal #1: to have a system that  manages their data better>
* < Goal #2: assure quick access to their data>
* < Goal #3: assure data loss prevention>

### The Solution ###

We as a team of experts in our field offer a logical recommendations to this problem. We can develop a software for you that can solve your problems and make efficient use of your time, energy and help you manage your archive better.

We offer these recommendations:


* < Recommendation #1: desktop based TV Archive Manager System>
* < Recommendation #2: web based TV Archive manger System(TAM)>

OUR PROPOSAL
------------------------

We are a team consisting of six people which can help you solve your problems and achieve your goals. Our team has the following members with their specific abilities.

1. Ahmad Jawid (Programmer & Software Engineer)
2. Fardin Hakimi (Software Engineer)
3. Ghazalle Zaheer (Database Designer)
4. Jalil Ahmad Fazely (Database Designer)
5. Aalem Daneshyar (Programmer)
6. Shah Agha (Programmer)

 We strongly recommend you the web based TV archive manger. Because it has the following advantages:

* Multiuser access to data.
* Better data management
* Accessing data over local network
* Ease of retrieving data
* Saves time and energy
* Better security over desktop based system.

 If you continue using the current way of archiving and managing your data, you are likely to face the following problems:

* Losing track of data
* High rate  of Data duplication
* High rate of losing data 
* Mismanagement of data
* Waste of time and energy
* Too much load of data
 
Our solution can enable Eslaah TV to fully realize the benefits of improved productivity throughout the use of our proposed system. Most importantly, we provide the training and support for this new solution.

### Rationale ###

Based on experience of other televisions in various parts of the world, traditional managing and archiving data is not a good idea. It is better to have a specific software to able to manage and archive data in an efficient manner.

### Execution Strategy ###

Our execution strategy incorporates proven methodologies, extremely qualified personnel, and a highly responsive approach to managing deliverables. Following is a description of our project methods, including how the project will be developed.

We will use the agile development method, and we will use two iterations to complete the whole project.

Iteration 1: 

* Archiving data capability
* Managing data capability

Iteration 2: 

* Quick access to data( retrieving capability)
* Having a report of data

INTERVIEW 
====================

INTERVIEWED BY: THE ALPHA TEAM  

INTERVIEWEE: MR. ABDULLAHI 


To have a better understanding of the project requirements we (The Alpha Team) 
came out to have an interview with the technical staff of the Eslaah TV. 

<b>Fazil:</b> You mentioned that you've worked for different TV stations, did they use any 
database system? 

<b>Technician:</b> Unfortunately no. None of the TV stations, even now, don't have a 
database system. 

<b>Jawid:</b> Do you only want to save the link/address of a file in the database or the file 
itself? 

<b>Technician:</b> No I need just the address of the file but it would be great if there is a 
preview for the specified file in the interface, only if possible. 

<b>Fazel:</b> What about the backup do you need the files to be backed up? 

<b>Technician:</b> Yes of course; we need the files to be automatically backed up, by 
schedule. And the path for backup should be manually specified. 

<b>Technician:</b> What do you think should we have a database for each section (Archive, 
Production, Management, and Editing)? 

<b>Jawid:</b> We have a solution for that, however it's a bit difficult, but we want to create 
web-based application for you to be accessed on the network for each section of your 
station. 

<b>Aalem:</b> how do you archive your files? 

<b>Technician:</b> Based on date, the files are categorized in two parts: Broadcasted and 
Non-broadcasted program. In each folder the category of the files are specified and 
the files are archived. The categorized archived files are then burned on DVDs.
 
<b>Aalem:</b> Even after this system is completed, would you still keep on archiving data on 
DVDs as hard copy? 

<b>Technician:</b> No, this is just a temporary solution to avoid losing data. We want to store 
the data on Hard Drives only. 

We want the programs to be archived and retrieved with/by the following details: 

* Name 
* Dates (Recording, Publishing, Archiving) 
* Category 
* Contents (Tags) 
* Duration of program 

<b>Technician:</b> We also need to have the ability to add a new category. And user/data 
management. 

<b>Jawid:</b> What about the reporting? 

<b>Technician:</b> We do need this ability for the following reports  

* General 
* Specified period of time 
* Categorized 
* Tags
