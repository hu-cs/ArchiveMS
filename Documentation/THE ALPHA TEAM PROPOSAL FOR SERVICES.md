OUR PROPOSAL
------------------------

We are a team consisting of six people which can help you solve your problems and achieve your goals. Our 
team has the following members with their specific abilities.

1. Ahmad Jawid (Programmer & Software Engineer)
2. Fardin Hakimi (Software Engineer)
3. Ghazalle Zaheer (Database Designer)
4. Jalil Ahmad Fazely (Database Designer)
5. Aalem Daneshyar (Programmer)

 We strongly recommend you the web based TV archive manger. Because it has the following advantages:

* Multiuser access to data.
* Better data management
* Accessing data over local network
* Ease of retrieving data
* Saves time and energy
* Better security over desktop based system.

 If you continue using the current way of archiving and managing your data, you are likely to face the 

following problems:

* Losing track of data
* High rate  of Data duplication
* High rate of losing data 
* Mismanagement of data
* Waste of time and energy
* Too much load of data
 
Our solution can enable Eslaah TV to fully realize the benefits of improved productivity throughout the use 

of our proposed system. Most importantly, we provide the training and support for this new solution.

### Rationale ###

Based on experience of other televisions in various parts of the world, traditional managing and archiving 

data is not a good idea. It is better to have a specific software to able to manage and archive data in an 

efficient manner.

### Execution Strategy ###

Our execution strategy incorporates proven methodologies, extremely qualified personnel, and a highly 

responsive approach to managing deliverables. Following is a description of our project methods, including 

how the project will be developed.

We will use the agile development method, and we will use two iterations to complete the whole project.
