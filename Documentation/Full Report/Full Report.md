### Execution Strategy ###

Our execution strategy incorporates proven methodologies, extremely qualified personnel, and a highly responsive approach to managing deliverables. Following is a description of our project methods, including how the project will be developed.

We will use the agile development method, and we will use two iterations to complete the whole project.

INTERVIEW 
====================

INTERVIEWED BY: THE ALPHA TEAM  

INTERVIEWEE: MR. ABDULLAHI 


To have a better understanding of the project requirements we (The Alpha Team) 
came out to have an interview with the technical staff of the Eslaah TV. 

<b>Fazil:</b> You mentioned that you've worked for different TV stations, did they use any 
database system? 

<b>Technician:</b> Unfortunately no. None of the TV stations, even now, don't have a 
database system. 

<b>Jawid:</b> Do you only want to save the link/address of a file in the database or the file 
itself? 

<b>Technician:</b> No I need just the address of the file but it would be great if there is a 
preview for the specified file in the interface, only if possible. 

<b>Fazel:</b> What about the backup do you need the files to be backed up? 

<b>Technician:</b> Yes of course; we need the files to be automatically backed up, by 
schedule. And the path for backup should be manually specified. 

<b>Technician:</b> What do you think should we have a database for each section (Archive, 
Production, Management, and Editing)? 

<b>Jawid:</b> We have a solution for that, however it's a bit difficult, but we want to create 
web-based application for you to be accessed on the network for each section of your 
station. 

<b>Aalem:</b> how do you archive your files? 

<b>Technician:</b> Based on date, the files are categorized in two parts: Broadcasted and 
Non-broadcasted program. In each folder the category of the files are specified and 
the files are archived. The categorized archived files are then burned on DVDs.
 
<b>Aalem:</b> Even after this system is completed, would you still keep on archiving data on 
DVDs as hard copy? 

<b>Technician:</b> No, this is just a temporary solution to avoid losing data. We want to store 
the data on Hard Drives only. 

We want the programs to be archived and retrieved with/by the following details: 

* Name 
* Dates (Recording, Publishing, Archiving) 
* Category 
* Contents (Tags) 
* Duration of program 

<b>Technician:</b> We also need to have the ability to add a new category. And user/data 
management. 

<b>Jawid:</b> What about the reporting? 

<b>Technician:</b> We do need this ability for the following reports  

* General 
* Specified period of time 
* Categorized 
* Tags
